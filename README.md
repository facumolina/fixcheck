# fixcheck
FixCheck is a tool for improving patch correctness analysis. 
Given a target Java patch, it uses static analysis and random testing to generate 
new inputs to test the patch, and LLMs to generate meaningful assertions for the new inputs. 
The new tests are executed and those that fail are selected and prioritised 
according to their likelihood of revealing a defect in the patch.

## Setting up FixCheck

### Requirements

- Java >= 17 (tested with 17)
- Python3 (tested with 3.11.5)

### Local Installation

To install FixCheck,  clone the repository, build the project with gradle and install the python requirements:
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/facumolina/fixcheck
cd fixcheck
./gradlew shadowJar 
pip3 install -r experiments/requirements.txt
pip3 install -r llms/requirements.txt
```

Finally, set up the FixCheck environment variable:
```bash  
export FIXCHECK=<path_to_thisrepo>
```

FixCheck is now ready to be used with the [replit-code](https://github.com/replit/ReplitLM/tree/main/replit-code-v1-3b) LLM. To use FixCheck with 
the codellama-7b-instruct model, the following additional steps are required:
```bash  
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/CodeLlama-7B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/codellama-7b-instruct.Q5_K_M.gguf?download=true -P llms/models/
```
> [!Note]
> Here we are using a version of the codellama-7b-instruct model in the GGUF format  
> obtained through quantization. The GGUF format is developed by the [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) 
> team, with the goal to enable LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance.
 
### Docker

We provide a `Dockerfile` that can be used to build a docker image with 
FixCheck and all its dependencies. To build and run the docker image, 
execute the following commands:
```bash  
docker build -t fixcheck .
docker run -it fixcheck
```
> [!Note]
> Building the image may take a while, as it will download and install all the dependencies for running
> FixCheck, and also to analyze the example patches discussed below.

> [!Note]
> Also, FixCheck will be installed to be used with the replit-code LLM. 
> To use the codellama-7b-instruct model, the corresponding model file needs 
> to be downloaded as explained in the previous section.

## Using FixCheck

### Example

This section contains a simple example analysing a patch from [DefectRepairing](https://github.com/Ultimanecat/DefectRepairing), 
a benchmark of correct and incorrect patches generated by APR tools. 

> [!Note]
> If you are using the Docker image, defects4j and DefectRepairing are already installed, 
> so you can move to the setup step.

To run FixCheck on any of these patches, perform the following steps:

1. Download and install [defects4j](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j) (make sure the command defects4j is available)
2. Download the [DefectRepairing](https://github.com/Ultimanecat/DefectRepairing) benchmark

After that, the following variable needs to be set:
```bash  
export DEFECT_REPAIRING_DATASET=<path_to_defectrepairing> 
```

Before the actual execution of FixCheck, a setup step is needed, that essentially will 
clone the project corresponding to the patch under analysis, 
apply the patch and build the project. 
For instance, to analyse the Patch1, the setup can be performed by running:
```bash  
python3 experiments/setup-defect-repairing.py Patch1
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running the setup script, Java 8 should be configured, as it is required to build Defects4J projects.

From this point, we can now execute FixCheck as follows:
```bash
nohup python3 llms/replit-code.py &  
python3 experiments/run-fixcheck-defect-repairing.py Patch1 org.imdea.fixcheck.assertion.ReplitCodeLLM
```
The first script will setup the `replit-code` language model, and leave it ready to be called by FixCheck. The second script will automatically extract the arguments from the file `experiments/defect-repairing-subjects.csv`, and call FixCheck with the right parameters. For instance, the command used for the Patch1 subject is the following:
```bash  
java -cp build/libs/fixcheck-all-1.0.0.jar:$DEFECT_REPAIRING_DATASET/tmp/Patch1/Chart1b/build:$DEFECT_REPAIRING_DATASET/tmp/Patch1/Chart1b/build-tests org.imdea.fixcheck.FixCheck 
  -tp $DEFECT_REPAIRING_DATASET/tmp/Patch1/Chart1b/build-tests 
  -tc org.jfree.chart.renderer.category.junit.AbstractCategoryItemRendererTests 
  -tm test2947660 
  -ts $DEFECT_REPAIRING_DATASET/tmp/Patch1/Chart1b/tests 
  -i java.lang.String 
  -tf $DEFECT_REPAIRING_DATASET/tmp/Patch1/Chart1b/failing_tests 
  -np 100 
  -ag org.imdea.fixcheck.assertion.CodeLlamaInstruct
```
Other patches from the [DefectRepairing](https://github.com/Ultimanecat/DefectRepairing) benchmark can also be analysed following the same procedure, as they are all configured in the csv file `experiments/defect-repairing-subjects.csv`.

### Analysing Patches from other sources

In general, to analyse patches from other sources, the following steps are needed:
1. Build the **buggy** version of the project corresponding to the patch under analysis
2. Run the fault revealing test to collect its failure trace
3. Apply the patch to the project
4. Build the **patched** version of the project
5. Run FixCheck with the right parameters
